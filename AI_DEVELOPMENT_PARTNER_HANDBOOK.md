# AI Development Partner Handbook
*A comprehensive guide for maximizing AI assistant effectiveness in software development*

## üéØ **CORE PHILOSOPHY: USER SUCCESS FIRST**

The AI assistant's primary goal is to help the user ship working software quickly and efficiently. Technical elegance is secondary to user success.

---

## üî• **CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED**

### **The Great ElevenLabs Debugging Disaster of 2025**

**What Went Wrong**: Spent hours debugging deployment and caching issues when the real problem was missing `system_prompt` field in API payload.

**Root Cause**: AI assistant jumped to complex infrastructure theories instead of validating basic data requirements.

**User's Winning Insight**: "Could the problem be that we don't have a system prompt and first message setup which is probably a basic thing needed for it to create an agent?"

**Key Lesson**: Domain knowledge + business logic thinking > technical complexity assumptions.

---

## üîç **DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY (MANDATORY ORDER)**

### **Phase 1: Data Validation (ALWAYS FIRST)**
1. **Input Analysis**: What data is actually being sent?
2. **Requirement Check**: What does the API/service actually require?
3. **Field Mapping**: Are all required fields present and correctly formatted?
4. **Type Validation**: Are data types correct (string vs number, etc.)?
5. **Null/Undefined Check**: Are we sending undefined values that break APIs?

### **Phase 2: Business Logic Validation**
1. **Domain Requirements**: What does this feature need to work in the real world?
2. **User Expectation**: What would a user expect this to do?
3. **Service Dependencies**: What external services are involved and what do they require?

### **Phase 3: Technical Investigation**
1. **Error Message Analysis**: Get actual error responses, don't guess
2. **API Documentation**: Read the actual docs, don't assume
3. **Test in Isolation**: Test each component separately

### **Phase 4: Infrastructure (LAST RESORT)**
1. **Deployment Issues**: Only after ruling out data/logic problems
2. **Caching Problems**: Only after confirming code is correct
3. **Network/Auth Issues**: Only after basic functionality works

## üö´ **ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID**

### **1. Assumption Jumping**
- ‚ùå "It must be a deployment issue"
- ‚ùå "The cache is probably stale"
- ‚úÖ "Let me check what data we're actually sending"

### **2. Complex-First Debugging**
- ‚ùå Adding extensive logging before checking basics
- ‚ùå Setting up local dev environments before validating inputs
- ‚úÖ Compare expected vs actual data first

### **3. Solution Hopping**
- ‚ùå Trying 5 different fixes without understanding the problem
- ‚úÖ Fully investigate one theory before moving to the next

### **4. Technical Tunnel Vision**
- ‚ùå Focusing only on code/infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Think about business requirements and user needs

---

## üéØ **PROACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS**

### **Before Writing Any Code**
1. **Validate Requirements**: What exactly does this feature need to do?
2. **Check Dependencies**: What external APIs/services are involved?
3. **Read Documentation**: What are the actual requirements for integrations?
4. **Plan Data Flow**: What data flows where and in what format?

### **API Integration Checklist**
- [ ] Read the official API documentation thoroughly
- [ ] Identify all required fields and their formats
- [ ] Check authentication requirements
- [ ] Understand error response formats
- [ ] Test with minimal working example first
- [ ] Validate all data before sending to API

### **Frontend-Backend Communication**
- [ ] Define exact data structures being passed
- [ ] Ensure frontend sends all required backend fields
- [ ] Validate that backend passes all required API fields
- [ ] Handle undefined/null values appropriately
- [ ] Test the complete data flow end-to-end

---

## üîß **TECHNICAL BEST PRACTICES**

### **Error Handling**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Comprehensive error information
try {
  const result = await api.call(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API Error Details:', {
    endpoint: 'api.call',
    payload: data,
    error: error.message,
    response: error.response?.data
  });
  throw error;
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Generic error handling
try {
  const result = await api.call(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Something went wrong');
  throw error;
}
```

### **Data Validation**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Remove undefined values
const payload = {
  name: agent.name,
  system_prompt: agent.system_prompt,
  voice_id: agent.voice_id
};

// Remove undefined fields
Object.keys(payload).forEach(key => {
  if (payload[key] === undefined) {
    delete payload[key];
  }
});

// ‚ùå Bad: Send undefined values
const payload = {
  name: agent.name,
  system_prompt: undefined, // This breaks APIs!
  voice_id: undefined
};
```

### **Integration Patterns**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Edge Function for complex integrations
async createAgent(data) {
  // Call Edge Function that handles ElevenLabs integration
  const { data: result, error } = await supabase
    .functions.invoke('create-agent', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: data
    });
  
  if (error) throw error;
  return result.agent;
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Direct database insertion without integration
async createAgent(data) {
  // Bypasses ElevenLabs integration!
  const { data: result, error } = await supabase
    .from('agents')
    .insert(data);
    
  return result;
}
```

## üöÄ **DEVELOPMENT ACCELERATION STRATEGIES**

### **1. Start with Working Examples**
- Find official API examples that work
- Modify incrementally rather than building from scratch
- Test each change in isolation

### **2. Validate Early and Often**
- Test API calls with hardcoded data first
- Validate data structures before building UI
- Confirm integrations work before adding complexity

### **3. Document Decisions**
- Why did we choose this approach?
- What are the dependencies and requirements?
- What are the known limitations?

### **4. Think in User Journeys**
- What does the user want to accomplish?
- What's the simplest path to that outcome?
- What could go wrong from the user's perspective?

---

## üéØ **USER SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Ship working features quickly**
2. **Minimize debugging time**
3. **Create scalable, maintainable code**
4. **Enable user business success**

### **Success Indicators**
- Features work on first deployment
- Debugging sessions are rare and short
- User can focus on product, not technical issues
- Code is easy to extend and modify

### **Failure Indicators**
- Multiple hours spent on single bugs
- Repeated deployment/caching issues
- User has to identify obvious problems
- Features break when extended

---

## üîÑ **CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

### **After Each Development Session**
1. **What worked well?**
2. **What took longer than expected?**
3. **What would prevent similar issues?**
4. **What patterns can be reused?**

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Identify recurring problem types
- Create reusable solutions
- Build templates for common tasks
- Document gotchas and solutions

---

## üéØ **SESSION STARTUP CHECKLIST**

### **Beginning Every Development Session**
1. **Review this handbook** - especially recent lessons learned
2. **Understand the current goal** - what does the user want to achieve?
3. **Check existing architecture** - what's already built and how does it work?
4. **Identify dependencies** - what external services/APIs are involved?
5. **Plan validation approach** - how will we know this works?

### **Key Questions to Always Ask**
1. "What exactly are we trying to accomplish for the end user?"
2. "What are the minimum requirements for this to work?"
3. "What external dependencies are involved and what do they require?"
4. "How will we validate this works correctly?"
5. "What's the simplest implementation that meets the requirements?"

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY DEBUGGING PROTOCOL**

When something isn't working:

1. **STOP** - Don't make random changes
2. **DATA FIRST** - Check what's actually being sent/received
3. **DOCS SECOND** - Verify against official documentation
4. **ISOLATE THIRD** - Test components separately
5. **INFRASTRUCTURE LAST** - Only after ruling out data/logic issues

Remember: **Simple data problems often masquerade as complex infrastructure issues.**

---

## üìö **PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE**

### **Current Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Database + Edge Functions)
- **External APIs**: ElevenLabs Conversational AI
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

### **Key Integration Patterns**
- **Agent Creation**: Frontend ‚Üí API ‚Üí Edge Function ‚Üí ElevenLabs + Database
- **Agent Deletion**: Synchronized deletion from both database and ElevenLabs
- **Document Upload**: File ‚Üí Supabase Storage ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Database

### **Common Gotchas**
- ElevenLabs requires proper agent configuration (name, prompt, first_message)
- Supabase Edge Functions need proper CORS headers
- Frontend must handle undefined values before sending to APIs
- RLS policies must allow operations for authenticated users
